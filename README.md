A smoke-signal-like website for tracking the pilot light on my home's water heater.

## Description
The pilot light keeps going out on my water heater at home.  If it happens and I don't notice it I'm surprised with a cold
shower.  So I've decided to make a site that will have a visual indicator of whether the pilot light is on or not.

For those of you wondering about the name, lid is the Navajo word for smoke.  This is my smoke signal of sorts to 
warn me of cold showers approaching.
